Hover _selection in the editor is not sorted according to the terrain list.
Depending on order of putting occurrences into the hover list, the grouped
tile looks different.

Expected instead: _selection should be sorted before grouping and before
changing the z-order of tiles.

Don't know: When to sort? When adding things to selection? When entering
the function to make a group, or to z-order them?

Hover _hover may be unsorted. We shouldn't sort it, that may take too long.
