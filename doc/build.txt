How to build Lix from source
============================

Lix is written in the D Programming Language and uses Allegro 5.

I'm describing the build process for Linux. It should be very similar for
Windows. I don't know where you install libraries, though.



Installing D
------------

Install a compiler for the D Programming Language. I recommend dmd, which
can be downloaded for various platforms from here:

    http://dlang.org/download.html

You should install dub, the D packaging tool. dub automates the build process,
i.e., it replaces make, and it will fetch the D bindings for installed and
used libraries. Download here:

    http://code.dlang.org/download

If you want to search the web about D, use "dlang" in your query to get
better search results.



Installing the libraries
------------------------

Even though dub can download the libraries' D bindings from the dub website
and install them in ~/.dub for you, it cannot install the shared libraries
themselves to your system.

This part of the instructions is about installing binary files that can be
called from various programming languages. It's not particular to D.
We need the following libraries:

* zlib
* libpng
* Allegro 5
* enet, not needed right now, this is the networking library

You can get these from your distribution. Alternatively, go to the libraries'
homepages, download the source, then build and install them yourself.



Run dub
-------

Open a shell, navigate to Lix's root directory, and run

    dub

without arguments. dub will read the Lix packaging information in dub.json
and build the game, then run it.

The above command builds the debugging version. For maximum performance, you
can build the release version instead:

    dub -b release-nobounds

The release version might run faster, but cannot output useful information
in case of a crash.
