How to build Lix on a Linux machine
===================================

Lix is written in the D Programming Language and uses Allegro 5.

I'm describing the build process for Linux. It should be very similar for
Windows. I don't know where you install libraries, though.



Install a D compiler and dub
----------------------------

I recommend dmd v2.067 or newer to compile this, or one of the other
available D compilers. This explains how to set up dmd. Get it here:

    http://dlang.org/download.html

You should install dub, the D packaging tool. dub automates the build process,
i.e., it replaces make, and it will fetch the D bindings for installed and
used libraries. Download here:

    http://code.dlang.org/download

dub is a standalone binary, put it anywhere in your PATH.




Install required libraries
--------------------------

Even though dub can download the libraries' D bindings from the dub website
and install them in ~/.dub for you, it cannot install the shared libraries
themselves to your system.

This part of the instructions is about installing binary files that can be
called from various programming languages. It's not particular to D.
We need the following libraries:

* zlib
* libpng
* libvorbis
* freetype
* Allegro 5
* enet, not needed right now, this is the networking library

You can get these from your distribution. Alternatively, go to the libraries'
homepages, download the source, then build and install them yourself.

You should install the libraries in the order listed, because Allegro depends
on all others coming before it. enet doesn't depend on any of those.



Installing enet
---------------

Right now, August 2016, I rely on enet 1.3.x. Download it from enet.bespin.org,
or clone from github:

$ git clone https://github.com/lsalzman/enet

Lix uses enet via Derelict-enet. Derelict is a set of D library bindings and
wants dynamically linked libraries, not static libraries. Therefore, we will
build enet as a shared object:

$ autoreconf -vfi
$ ./configure --enable-shared=yes --enable-static=no
$ make
$ sudo make install

If the game doesn't find the newly-built lib, run sudo /sbin/ldconfig.



Build Lix
---------

Open a shell, navigate to Lix's root directory, and run:

    dub

This builds a debug version and runs it immediately. To play the game
at a later time, invoke dub again, or run:

    ./bin/lix

If the debugging version compiles, links, and runs with no problems, you
might want to build a release version for better performance:

    dub build -b release-nobounds
