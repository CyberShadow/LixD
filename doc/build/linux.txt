How to build Lix from source
============================

Lix is written in the D Programming Language and uses Allegro 5.

I'm describing the build process for Linux. It should be very similar for
Windows. I don't know where you install libraries, though.



Installing D
------------

I recommend dmd v2.067 or newer to compile this, or one of the other
available D compilers. This explains how to set up dmd. Get it here:

    http://dlang.org/download.html

You should install dub, the D packaging tool. dub automates the build process,
i.e., it replaces make, and it will fetch the D bindings for installed and
used libraries. Download here:

    http://code.dlang.org/download

If you want to search the web about D, use "dlang" in your query to get
better search results.



Installing the libraries
------------------------

Even though dub can download the libraries' D bindings from the dub website
and install them in ~/.dub for you, it cannot install the shared libraries
themselves to your system.

This part of the instructions is about installing binary files that can be
called from various programming languages. It's not particular to D.
We need the following libraries:

* zlib
* libpng
* libvorbis
* Allegro 5
* enet, not needed right now, this is the networking library

You can get these from your distribution. Alternatively, go to the libraries'
homepages, download the source, then build and install them yourself.

You should install the libraries in the order listed, because Allegro depends
on all others coming before it. enet doesn't depend on any of those.



Run dub
-------

Open a shell, navigate to Lix's root directory, and run:

    dub build

dub will read the Lix packaging information in dub.json and build the game.
Run ./bin/lix to play the game.

The above command (dub build) builds the debugging version. For maximum
performance, build the release version instead:

    dub build -b release-nobounds

The release version takes longer to compile, because the compiler will do
many extra optimizations. The resulting binary will run faster, but cannot
output useful information in case of a crash.
