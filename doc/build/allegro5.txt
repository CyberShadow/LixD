Lix requires Allegro 5.2.

Lix is guaranteed to fail with anything below Allegro 5.0.
In particular, it won't build with Allegro 4.x.

Most likely, Lix works with all of 5.2, 5.1 and 5.0. But these
Allegro 5 versions require different D dependencies. If you do not use
Allegro 5.2, edit `dub.json' in Lix's root directory. Find the line
"allegro": "~>4.0" in `dub.json', and replace "~>4.0" as such:

    You use...      ...then replace "~>4.0" with:
    Allegro 5.2     "~>4.0"
    Allegro 5.1     "~>3.0"
    Allegro 5.0     "~>2.0"

If you get compilation errors still, maybe they're in al_get_text_dimensions.
For Allegro 5.0, add two more parameters &_dummy to the end of the function:
It should take 3 dummy parameters, then the interesting one, then 2 dummies.

I am developing under Arch Linux, where Allegro 5.2 is the most recent
version. Older versions are unsupported. As of October 2016, everything
builds with Allegro 5.0, but I don't make any guarantee for the future.
