How to cross-compile Lix
========================

On a Linux machine, you can build Lix for Windows. The idea is to install
Wine, then the standard Windows toolchain to build D projects, and run it
all through Wine.

Install Wine.

Download dmd, the Digital Mars D compiler, for Windows. Run its installer
through Wine.

Download dub, and install it through Wine.

Follow `./doc/build/windows.txt' to install Allegro 5 and other libraries.
You have to put files where the Windows version of dmd will find them.
The default installation part of the Windows dmd compiler is
`~/.wine/drive_c/dmd'. Look around that directory for where to put the
files in particular.

When all libraries are installed, run:
$ wine dub
