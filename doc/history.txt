Version history of the Lix D/Allegro 5 port
===========================================

0.1.27
------

Miner implemented with geoo's anti-shock C++ code.

Flingers and trampolines are implemented.

0.1.26
------

2016-01-04

Singleplayer browser remembers the most recently played level.

Fixed bug #18: Assigning runner to a walker didn't make her run immediately.
Fixed bug #20: Assigning exploder to builder crashed the game due to
inability to return skills.

Fixed climber horizontal alignment with the wall, the alignment was set
correctly previously, but never reset correctly.

Exploder with flinging is now implemented similar to how it was in C++.
It should be checked for accuracy, once loading replays from disk is
implemented.

Fixed a crash on becoming tumbler. There is still an elusive assert fail
triggerable in the tumbler function. That should be debugged once replays
can be loaded from disk.

0.1.25
------

2016-01-03

Fixed bug #19: Tumbler selected only frames 2 or 3. Now, it selects its frame
by angle of flight now, while not advancing too far in any single frame.

0.1.24
------

2016-01-02

Fixed bug #10: Map drawing: Target area too large.
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/10

0.1.23
------

2016-01-01

Options menu complete. Some options don't do anything yet, but are loaded/saved
correctly nonetheless. Removed fullscreen resolution option. Switching users
works. Switching Language works.

I found the first bug of 2016 in the D compiler. ^_^

0.1.22
------

2015-12-31

Implemented GUI elements: Text entry, number picker, hotkey picker.
In the options menu, implemented 2/3 hotkey pages, and the graphics page.
Each hotkeyed button displays its hotkey in the bottom-right-hand corner.

Added 0.5f to the djvuM offset (the main font's vertical position), now
it looks great on 640x480, 800x600, 1280x1024, and 1400x1050.

0.1.21
------

2015-12-29

Implemented goals (exits), triggered traps, and dying outside of the level.
Implemented the Esc-during-level menu and the end-of-level menu. No browser
to save/view replays yet. Begun implementing the options menu.

0.1.17
------

2015-12-17

Bugfix: Blockers are now released upon walker assignment.

0.1.16
------

2015-12-16

All skills are implemented fully or mostly each, except for the miner,
which is missing completely still. Effects, like arrows, flying dig hammers,
and explosions, are missing.

Skills behave mostly identical to C++ Lix. Some extremely arcane behavioral
bugs were fixed while porting; report if things behave obviously strangely.
Probably also report if things behave differently.

Known differences: Exploder crater is 1 pixel smaller, diameter of 46 pixels
instead of 47 pixels, but should be completely symmetrical now. Blocker
doesn't get released on walker assignment; this fixed only in 0.1.17.

0.1.12
------

2015-11-30

Implemented builder and digger. The builder still draws on top of existing
land, which is merely a visual bug, not a physics bug. The digger makes
steel transparent, but the steel and terrain data inside the steel remains
present for physics; again only a visual bug.

0.1.5
-----

2015-11-19

Map detects mouse on the land properly, at least with zoom == 1. Priority
computation has been ported over. You can click lix and hear the assign
sound being played if the assignment were legal. Assignments aren't in yet.

0.1.4
-----

2015-11-15

Walker, Faller and Ascender are implemented and should perform like their
C++ versions. I would like to keep close to the C++ behavior for now.
Savestates have been implemented for framestepping. Skill assignments
are not possible yet.

0.1.2
-----

2015-10-30

Started implementing Lix skills. There will likely be no problem with them
scanning the terrain from the lookupmap. I'm anxious about them writing to
the terrain later on, when the more interesting skills get added.

0.1.0
-----

2015-08-24

First Windows build released on Lemmings Forums as a smoke test. It runs
well for most people. Drawing has bad performance still with about 3,500
animated gadgets, but is much better with about 200 than in the previous
months.

0.0.0
-----

2015-02-28

Started development by porting the fundamental Lix graphic classes from
Allegro 4.4 to Allegro 5 with the D Programming Language.
