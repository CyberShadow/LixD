Version history of the Lix D/Allegro 5 port
===========================================

0.1.2
-----

2015-10-30

Started implementing Lix skills. There will likely be no problem with them
scanning the terrain from the lookupmap. I'm anxious about them writing to
the terrain later on, when the more interesting skills get added.

0.1.0
-----

2015-08-24

First Windows build released on Lemmings Forums as a smoke test. It runs
well for most people. Drawing has bad performance still with about 3,500
animated gadgets, but is much better with about 200 than in the previous
months.

0.0.0
-----

2015-02-28

Started development by porting the fundamental Lix graphic classes from
Allegro 4.4 to Allegro 5 with the D Programming Language.
