Bugs in D/A5 Lix
================

The bugtracker on asdfasdf.etzh.ch/~simon/ lists the bugs for C++/A4 Lix.
Here are the bugs specific to D/A5 Lix.

Drawing mode "noow" not implemented

    No-overwrite drawing, if used in levels, aborts the game due to
    unimplemented function. (assertion failure)

No ogg support -> bad log message

    The message is "file not found", even though the ogg files are present.
    Should stat the files to see if they're present, and give the correct
    message. If they exist, say that Lix was compiled without ogg support.

Bad font size guessing

    I've done something for it, test if it's good on most resolutions.
    You can test arbitrary windowed resolutions: bin/lix --resol=800x600

    Original bug: geoo has a widescreen and the fonts were way too small.
    The relative font size seemed OK, but both font sizes were small.

Ignoring large animated tiles

    The game can't load very large graphics as video bitmaps: amanda/tar.W.png
    and amanda/occult/hatch_tentacle.H.png were both over 4,000 pixels wide.
    Currently, I skip over them and let the level have a missing-image error.
    See the log file if you get missing-image errors despite having the image.

Delayed sound

    On Debian 6, without pulseaudio installed, with ALSA installed,
    each sound playback is delayed by about 0.5 seconds. When it finally
    starts, the sound plays back well.

    Workaround: Compile Allegro 5 yourself, and edit the source so that
    it uses OpenAL or OSS instead of Alsa. The sound is still delayed by 0.1
    seconds or so with OpenAL.

No loading of L1/L2 graphic sets or levels

    This will either not come at all, or be implemented very late in the port.
    Since I like Lix as my tool to play L1 levels, it'll come probably.

Mouse leaves window

    Run the game -w for windowed mode.
    While no freeze direction is called in hardware.mouse, move the mouse
    around very fast. The OS cursor will be shown outside the window
    occasionally. Holding RMB to freeze directions prevents this.

    Expected: Cursor should be prevented from leaving even without freezing
    directions.
