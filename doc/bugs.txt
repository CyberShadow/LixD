Bugs in D/A5 Lix
================

The bugtracker on asdfasdf.etzh.ch/~simon/ lists the bugs for C++/A4 Lix.
Here are the bugs specific to D/A5 Lix.

Delayed sound

    On Debian 6, without pulseaudio installed, with ALSA installed,
    each sound playback is delayed by about 0.5 seconds. When it finally
    starts, the sound plays back well.

No loading of L1/L2 graphic sets or levels

    This will either not come at all, or be implemented very late in the port.
    Since I like Lix as my tool to play L1 levels, it'll come probably.
