Tips for level maintainers
==========================

Automatic replay verification
-----------------------------

To run the automatic replay checker on your directory full of replays:

    lix --verify=replays/path/to/dir

This tests every replay in replays/path/to/dir/ for whether it solves its
the pointed-to level. Here, Lix will never consider the level included in
the replay file. Lix will open the level in the level tree, and run the
replay against that.

Sometimes, you don't care whether every single replay solves, but only
whether every level has at least one solution. Use --coverage to perform a
level coverage analysis after your mass-replay checking:

    lix --verify=replays/path/to/dir --coverage

In addition to the normal replay checking results, this lists all levels
without replay coverage. A level is listed iff it satisfies all points here:

*   The level file resides in directory from which you have tested at
    least one playable level. Subdirectories don't count.

    Example: You test a replay `replays/mydir/replay.txt' and this replay
    points to the level `levels/mylevels/a.txt'. No matter whether the
    replay solves the level or not, both `levels/mylevels/a.txt' and
    `levels/mylevels/b.txt' are considered for coverage analysis,
    but not `levels/mylevels/mysubdir/c.txt'.

*   Not a single replay in this entire noninteractive run of the application
    has proven the level solvable.
