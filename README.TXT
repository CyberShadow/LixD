Lix?
====

This shall become a port of Lix to the D Programming Language using Allegro 5.
It's still in an early state, demonstrating the basic Lix graphics classes.

How to build
------------

Look in the directory `./doc/build/' and read the file for your operating
system, either `linux.txt' or `windows.txt'. If you get stuck, those files
also explain how to contact me. Ignore `cross.txt' for now: I've described
how I started setting up cross-compilation on Linux for Windows. I have not
been succesful with that.

<NaOH>   to be honest, I thought you were joking when you first said you were
         going to redo this in D, but it looks like you've made some good
         progress.
<SimonN> yes, it's become a serious port attempt; there's too much invested
         already to abort it anytime soon
