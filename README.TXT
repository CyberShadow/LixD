Lix?
====

This shall become a port of Lix to the D Programming Language using Allegro 5.
It's still in an early state, demonstrating the basic Lix graphics classes.

Read doc/build/linux.txt on how to build this.

I'd love to hear results from a Windows user. I haven't set up a D environment
on Windows yet, but I can try to walk you through it, if you're willing to
test this on Windows. :-)

<NaOH>   to be honest, I thought you were joking when you first said you were
         going to redo this in D, but it looks like you've made some good
         progress.
<SimonN> yes, it's become a serious port attempt; there's too much invested
         already to abort it anytime soon
