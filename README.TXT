Lix?
====

This shall become a port of Lix to the D Programming Language using Allegro 5.
It's still in an early state, demonstrating the basic Lix graphics classes.

How to build
------------

Look in the directory `./doc/build/' and read the file for your operating
system, either `linux.txt' or `windows.txt'.

In `cross.txt', I've described how I started setting up cross-compilation
on Linux for Windows. I have not been succesful with that.

How to test
-----------

Right now, you need to make the directory `./levels/' yourself, and put some
levels from C++/A4 lix in that directory. Graphic sets are included in D/A5
Lix already.
