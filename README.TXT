Lix?
====

This shall become a port of Lix (github.com/SimonN/Lix) to the D Programming
Language using Allegro 5. It's still in an early-to-medium state. You can
already watch lix walking around the levels.

How to build
------------

Please read `./doc/build/linux.txt' or `.doc/build/windows.txt', according
to your operating system. If you get stuck, feel free to contact me.
Ignore `cross.txt' for now, I haven't cross-compiled this successfully yet.

<NaOH>   to be honest, I thought you were joking when you first said you were
         going to redo this in D, but it looks like you've made some good
         progress.
<SimonN> yes, it's become a serious port attempt; there's too much invested
         already to abort it anytime soon
<NaOH>   ^sunk cost fallacy?
<SimonN> sunk love
