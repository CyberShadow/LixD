** Parallel Universe **
The Epic Adventure continued Story

During your epic adventure, you have
discovered eight closed portals
in random locations. After your
adventure, the portals have opened!
You set off to explore the portals in
groups of six and packing many
abilities for safety.

Unfortunately the abilities somehow
became split when the groups
entered the portals!

Unknowingly, each group have
materialized in a cave with
identical landscape.

Getting home will now prove to
be a difficult challenge.

Regrettably some friends will need
to be sacrificed to let others return!
